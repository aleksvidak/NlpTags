# NlpTags
Code in this project is a result of research on natural language processing. It is based on Stanford CoreNLP framework and other helpful projects found on the internet regarding this subject.
It is still work in progress and it is not something that can be useful to public yet.
I will try to fix some of the many mistakes made during coding, but in the meantime, this is a fine start.
